# Security Configuration Instructions

## Function Security (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
The following security fixes have been applied via database migration `008_fix_function_security.sql`:

- ‚úÖ `update_updated_at_column()` - Added secure search_path
- ‚úÖ `insert_contact_result()` - Added secure search_path  
- ‚úÖ `cleanup_duplicate_contacts()` - Added secure search_path

All functions now use `SET search_path = public` to prevent SQL injection via search_path manipulation.

## Authentication Security (üîß MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED)

### Enable Leaked Password Protection

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** The following step must be completed manually in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pqvqtfgocglxpovcydar
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** ‚Üí **Email**
3. Scroll down to **Password Protection**
4. Enable **"Prevent sign ups with leaked passwords"**
5. Click **Save**

This feature integrates with HaveIBeenPwned.org to prevent users from using compromised passwords during registration.

### Why This Matters
- Protects against users setting compromised passwords
- Reduces account takeover risks
- Enhances overall application security
- Industry best practice for authentication security

### Security Benefits Applied
- ‚úÖ **Function injection protection** - All database functions secured with proper search_path
- üîß **Leaked password protection** - Must be enabled in dashboard (manual step above)
- ‚úÖ **Row Level Security optimized** - Previously completed
- ‚úÖ **Database indexes optimized** - Previously completed
