      6. Trusted news coverage
      7. Public code repos (GitHub, GitLab) if relevant

    üìä Required data fields:
      - Funding history (summarize, latest round clearly stated)
      - Top 5 technologies in use (tech stack)
      - Product updates (max 3 recent ones)
      - Technical challenges or pain points (max 3, inferred from credible sources)
      - Key team leaders (names & titles)
      - Contact:
          * CEO, CTO, founding engineer, hiring manager, talent acquisition partner, or most active senior engineer and people who are hiring and are likely to respond to cold emails
          * Include their email if confidently found from trusted sources
          * If no email is public, generate a **likely** email based on observed company email format (e.g. first.last@company.com)
          * Mark invented emails with "likely": true

      - No duplicate sources in "points" and "sources".
      - Ensure JSON is minified but human-readable when rendered.
